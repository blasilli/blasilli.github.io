I am a PhD student in Engineering in Computer Science at [Sapienza Universit√† di Roma](https://www.uniroma1.it){:target="_blank"}, and a member of [A.W.A.RE](http://aware.diag.uniroma1.it){:target="_blank"} research group. My main research interests include Visual Analytics for Explainable Machine Learning applied to the Cybersecurity domain. In particular, my research focuses on supporting humans in decision-making regarding cyber threat analysis and management by using explainable Visual Analytics solutions. On these topics, I have published more than ten publications in peer-reviewed international journals and conferences.
